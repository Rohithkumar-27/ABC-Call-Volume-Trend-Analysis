# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
The goal of this project was to analyze the call volume data of an insurance company's inbound call team and identify trends in call patterns. I calculated the average call duration for each time bucket and created pivot tables to visualize call volume trends. Additionally, I conducted manpower planning analysis, calculating the minimum number of agents needed per time bucket to reduce the call abandonment rate. This project also involved night shift manpower planning, proposing strategies to address the companyâ€™s customer service issues during off-peak hours. The analysis helped the company optimize its workforce allocation and improve overall customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and ensuring more calls were answered.
